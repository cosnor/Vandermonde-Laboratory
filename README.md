## Vandermonde Matrix for Polynomial Interpolation

### Requirements

• Construct the corresponding Vandermonde matrix for the given x-values.
• Solve the resulting system of equations to find the polynomial coefficients.

### Input

An array of points(x,y)

### Output

• The interpolating polynomial in symbolic form.
• The values of the polynomial evaluated at its roots.

## Solution

The solution does not require any library, it only needs you to change the array of points named *puntos* at the beginning of *main.py*. Then, you execute the sript. The answer will be in front of you. 

The Vandermonde matrix is created in *main.py*. The symbolic element is done with Oriented Object Programming (OPP), shown in *simbols.py*. The functions used are in *functions.py*.
